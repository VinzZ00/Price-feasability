# Price-feasability
to compare a price of 2 phone with the help of ML linear regression to see which one is more worth it and which one does not worth it

this is a module that can be used to compare 2 mobile apps price to see whether which one is more worthy.
firstly, I create a Linear regression machine learning to be trained with datas, I use the data I get from kaggles 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification this is the data of a phone specification and are classified into 3 type 
of price low, middle and high depends on the spec. but mostly we usually have difficulties on comparing the spec and price of phones so I create this simple module 
to help people compare mobile phone. hope you like it!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

feel free to fork 
and I will be very happy if you guys dm me to let me know how I may improve this project.
