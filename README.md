# Price-feasability
to compare a price of 2 phone with the help of ML linear regression to see which one is more worth it and which one does not worth it

this is a module that can be used to compare 2 mobile apps price to see whether which one is more worthy.
firstly, I create a Random Forest machine learning to be trained with datas, 
secondly, I import the data that I need, I use the data I get from kaggles 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification this is the data of a phone specification and are classified into 3 type 
of price low, middle and high depends on the spec. but mostly we usually have difficulties on comparing the spec and price of phones so I create this simple module to help people compare mobile phone. hope you like it!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
thirdly, I fit the data that I have processed a bit, I delete some columns that I think this must be deleted if not, the models can't be accurate, for example like colors and other,
finally, I create a object class of a phone, and a class to call the module and and use the module to predict the phone and then the predicted value will be a float, we will use the float to be compared, a high price will have to be the price of the phone with the higher prediction value, if not than the phone is not worth it, for more detail information you try my apps. Thankyou.
